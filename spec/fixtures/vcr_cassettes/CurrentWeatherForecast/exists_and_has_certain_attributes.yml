        May 28 to 400 PM Friday May 29 IMPACTS...Ozone Action Day Alert is now in
        effect for the seven- county Denver- Boulder metropolitan area. Requests to
        limit driving are now in effect until at least 4 PM Friday, May 29, 2020.
        Hot and sunny weather, along with light winds, will lead to concentrations
        of ozone that are Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups on Friday. The highest concentrations
        of ozone are most likely for locations in the western portions of the Denver
        Metro area, and northward along the Front Range and lower foothills through
        Boulder, Longmont, and western Fort Collins. For areas included in this advisory
        that are not expected to exceed the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) air
        quality designation, we request that activities, such as driving, be reduced
        to lessen the impacts on neighboring air quality. Additional air pollution
        in this region may directly diminish air quality or contribute to precursors
        which may also adversely affect air quality. For Colorado air quality conditions,
